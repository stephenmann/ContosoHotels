## 🏢 Business Logic

### Room Availability
The system checks room availability by ensuring no overlapping bookings exist for the requested date range. The availability algorithm considers:
- Check-in and check-out dates
- Existing confirmed bookings
- Room status (active/inactive)

### Pricing Logic
- Base prices defined per room type
- Ocean view rooms have a 30% premium
- Higher floors more likely to have ocean views
- Dynamic pricing based on amenities

### Booking Status Workflow
1. **Pending**: Initial booking state
2. **Confirmed**: Payment processed and booking confirmed
3. **CheckedIn**: Guest has arrived and checked in
4. **CheckedOut**: Guest has completed stay
5. **Cancelled**: Booking was cancelled
